hashes
programming on hash
hash is mainly used as a replacement of array
if two parallel arrays are present.we face complexity to perform operations on them
if we need to (modify,add,remove) any array values,we must do the same with another array.
hash contain the data in the form of (key,value) and i can take any object as a index.
